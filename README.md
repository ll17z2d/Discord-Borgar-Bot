# Discord-Borgar-Bot
This is a console application C# Discord bot that converts Spotify playlists/albums to YouTube playlists. This can be used for the 
existing + widely used Rythm bot to play spotify playlists in Discord (this bot has now been disabled, very sad), or for preservation
of existing playlists onto a publically available YouTube playlist.
